# JL PORTFOLIO

Docket System is a web application that helps organize the department's inquest and investigation records through CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) method and saves records to a local database. This is our intern project from the Department of Justice Davao. Our team consists of 3 members and I was assigned as one of the team's developers.
